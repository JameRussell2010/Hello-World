# hello-world
Experimental Repository
I am new at this, and want to learn Github and Git.

So I have been focused on learning programming languages, and really messed up because I went through 6 or 7 but way too quickly, just to get them done and did not get the basic fundamentals down. 
So now I am going back through them and focusing on two, Python (mostly, at the moment) and JS because I may want to create some websites for others. 
I am going to try Frontend Mentors and see how that works to get a start without ruining someone else's program by inexperience.
