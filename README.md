Experimental Repository
I am new at this, and want to learn Github and Git.<br/>

So I have been focused on learning programming languages, and really messed up because I went through 6 or 7 but way too quickly, just to get them done and did not get the basic fundamentals down.<br/> 
So now I am going back through them and focusing on two, C (mostly, at the moment) and CSS because I may want to create some websites for others. <br/>
I am going to try Frontend Mentors and see how that works to get a start without ruining someone else's program by inexperience.

20230324 So I signed up for Pro in Frontend Mentor to see how that is going to go for learning. Seems I only really need to use the courses for references along with MDN docs
20231222 Have a 2 year Pro on Codecademy now at a massive discount! Awesome!!!
20240210 Now doing a reassessment of what I am doing, I think at my age I am having some memory issues, just finished a C course and there are still 3 unfinishedd projects I could not do. We'll work on those.
  Now I am going to start working on my CSS again, Alper is really busting his ass to help me get some of these principles down, and giving me reading material as well.
